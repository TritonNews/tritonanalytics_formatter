Tuition is going up, resources are being stripped away. As students, we need to hold our university accountable. I report the news to help amplify student voices and to cover events that affect the entire campus. Prior to The Triton, I had no experience in journalism. It’s still mind blowing to see my articles being published and reaching beyond our campus. Seeing my drafts being ripped apart by my editors hurts my soul a little bit sometimes, but it’s always rewarding to see my personal improvement. I am proud to be part of such a brilliant group that works selflessly and endlessly to uncover the truth and to reflect the current climate of our campus. In the era of fake news, all we can look to is honest, ethical journalism.&quot;

To me, being editor-in-chief means I've been entrusted with keeping this organization going, and more than that, keeping it growing It has helped me stay informed about what's going on around me. Working here has kept me critical of events that happen, but also inspired by the work students do and the persistent curiosity of our reporters. It's shaped how I've thought of my future. I hope that journalism becomes more a part of our campus culture, so that people anticipate both being held accountable, and being able to have their hard work recognized.&quot;
